The study investigates the use of predictive algorithms for image classification tasks using the Fashion MNIST dataset in response to the increasing availability of large and diverse datasets. The study showcases three independent models—XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to examine their efficacy in automated pattern recognition and representation learning.
The major goal of the study is to identify the model with the greatest accuracy in categorising fashion products. The CNN model emerges as the most powerful after a careful study and experimentation phase, obtaining an accuracy of 94%. However, a continuous difficulty across all models is misclassifying the "Shirt" class, which is frequently confused for "T-shirts," "Pullovers," and other related categories due to visual similarities.
The findings demonstrate CNNs' superiority over standard machine learning models by demonstrating their ability to extract detailed patterns and characteristics from images. Despite its general effectiveness, the study shines light on the unique obstacles involved with identifying certain clothing classes, particularly "Shirts", emphasizing the importance of ongoing image classification tasks.
